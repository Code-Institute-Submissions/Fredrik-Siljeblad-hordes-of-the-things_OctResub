-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Black and Purple, to resonate with the color scheme of the rulebook.
    -   #### Typography
        -   As main font I have chosen Noto Sans, with Sans Serif as a fallback font family. Noto Sans is clean and easy to read.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Miniature wargaming is in large part about the visual aspect. The Hero image is chosen to give the impression of joining a gaming table.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First time visitor, I want to quickly get an idea about the sites content.

        1. The main focus on the index page is the Hero image that immediately conveys the idea of a miniature wargame.
        2. Clearly visible in the upper left corner is the Hordes of the Things heading, showing what game the site covers.
        3. To improve the visibility of the images (miniatures, after all are small) on smaller devices, we cut down the number of columns in the gallery section as the screen size becomes smaller.
     

    2. As a First time visitor, I want the navigation between the different parts of the site to be easy and self-explanatory. I.E. - a link named "Gallery" should lead to the gallery.

        1. At the top of the Hero image is the navigation bar, with the Home, About, Gallery, Community and Contact links.
       

     3. As a First time visitor I want to be able to quickly navigate through the content on the site to see what content might be for me.
        1. The navigation bar is the same on each page, making it easy to move from page to page, without having to move back or forth.
        2. The navigation bar is always on top of the reader, so the user does not have to scroll to get back to it.
