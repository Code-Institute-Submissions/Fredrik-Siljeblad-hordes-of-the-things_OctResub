                <h3 id="whatisit">What is tabletop miniature wargaming?</h3>
                <p>To be perfectly honest it is mainly a way for grown ups to play with toy soldiers. 
                    There is a little bit more to it than that though.</p>
                <h4>Social</h4>
                <p>Most games are social activities. Recreational wargaming often is less about winning and more 
                    about playing out the story. What happens on the battlefield ("battlefield" is the 
                    pretentious word often used to describe the playing area.) is as entertaining to the one 
                    giving the orders as to the one being the victim of them.</p>
                
                <h4></h4>
                <h3 id="history">History</h3>
                <p>Games like chess, go or hnefatafl have been used to teach military skills for thousands 
                    of years. In the 19th century the Preussian army came up with their "Kriegsspiel" 
                    (simply "Wargame" in German") with rulesets much less abstract and much more focused on 
                    simulating actual military action.</p>
                <p>In 1913 author and known pacifist H.G. Wells published a book named "Little Wars". This 
                    is widely recognized as the first set of rules for recreational wargaming. While Little Wars 
                    incorporated many of the elements we today see in miniature wargaming (as - miniatures, 
                    terrain modelled to scale and measuring of distances its rules for combat outcomes were 
                    still rudimentary. Up until the 1950’s the hobby still was miniscule. In the UK, Donald 
                    Featherstone published a series of books on wargaming. In 1956 Jack Scruby of California 
                    organized the first miniature wargaming convention in America, one year after he began 
                    producing cheap miniatures intended for wargaming out of type metal. It had 14 attendants, 
                    but now the ball was rolling. Another milestone that also happened in the 50s was the 
                    first miniature wargame rule set for medieval combat by Tony Bath. This turned out to 
                    be a great inspiration to Gary Gygax Chainmail in 1971, which evolved into Dungeons & 
                    Dragons 1974. About ten years later the UK company Games Workshop published the first 
                    edition of Warhammer The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-Playing Game. In 1969 Wargames 
                    Research Group was founded and published the ruleset War Game Rules: 1000 B.C. to 
                    500 A.D. The following years rule sets generally became more and more involved and 
                    complex. In 1988 Phil Barker (one of the founders of Wargames Research Group) tried 
                    out a experimental set of rules at the Society of Ancients conference. It was a 
                    minimalistic ruleset of merely 2 pages, played on a small table only 2’x2’, with 
                    only 12 elements of 1-5 miniatures a side. The game caught on, and in 1990 De Bellis 
                    Antiquitatis was published. Keeping the philosophy of the experimental rules and adding 
                    list for armies covering 2000 years of warfare and most cultures on earth it became 
                    immensely popular. Only one year later a fantasy version was published. Hordes of the 
                    Things.

                    <h3 id="whysmall">Why is it a small game?</h3>
                    <p>Compared to many other miniature games Hordes of the Things can be considered as a 
                        very small one for several reasons:</p>
                    <h4>Minature Count</h4>
                    <p>Hordes of the Things is a game of battles, rather than a skirmish game, the 
                        the difference being that a skirmish game is about individual combatants 
                        whereas a battle game is about units. Unlike many battle games however you don't 
                        need an enormous amount of miniatures to play. An army typically consists of 10-14 
                        elements of troops, each element consisting of one to five miniatures mounted on 
                        a singe base.</p>
                    <h4>Space</h4>
                    <p>Depending on the miniature scale chose the game is usually played on a battlefield 600 
                        mm by 600 mm, or 900 mm by 900 mm. A pub table is sufficient, and you might even have space
                        for your beverage of choice.</p>
                    <h4>Time</h4>
                    <p>Playing a game of Hordes of the Things rarely takes more time than an hour, including 
                        setting up everything and putting everything away.</p>
                    <h3 id="whybig">Big</h3>
                    <p>At the same time the game gives the feeling of large battles, sweeping movement of large 
                        bodies of troops, and a true ebb and flow of battle.</p>
