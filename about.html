                    <h3 id="whatisit">What is tabletop miniature wargaming?</h3>
                    <p>To be perfectly honest it is mainly a way for grown ups to play with toy soldiers. 
                        There is a little bit more to it than that though. Today it is a combination of 
                        several different activites. Playing the games is usually a social activity. 
                        Building and painting the models and terrain is a creative one, just as coming up
                        with armies and scenarios is. Many historical wargamers engage in a lot of study 
                        of history, from as specific as researching uniforms of units to more sweeping 
                        understanding of general development of human history.</p>
                    <h4>Social</h4>
                    <p>Most games are social activities. Recreational wargaming often is less about winning and more 
                        about playing out the story. What happens on the battlefield ("battlefield" is the 
                        pretentious word often used to describe the playing area.) is as entertaining to the one 
                        giving the orders as to the one being the victim of them. Many gamers spend more time 
                        running groups, clubs and events than actually playing the games.</p>
                    <h4>Creativity</h4>
                    <p>The miniatures, the "toy soldiers" are usually bought, but often modified and nearly 
                        always painted before putting them on the table. Building terrain to make the table 
                        visually pleasing is a hobby all of its own. As is 3-D modelling and printing, that 
                        have become more and more a part of the miniature wargame hobby the last years, with 
                        printers becoming more affordable and easier to use. Fantasy gaming often involves 
                        writing up background stories for armies, battles, worlds and individuals. It certainly
                        does incentivises people to read.

                    <h3 id="history">History</h3>
                    <p>Games like chess, go or hnefatafl have been used to teach military skills for thousands 
                        of years. In the 19th century the Preussian army came up with their "Kriegsspiel" 
                        (simply "Wargame" in German") with rulesets much less abstract and much more focused on 
                        simulating actual military action.</p>
                    <p>In 1913 author and known pacifist H.G. Wells published a book named "Little Wars". This 
                        is widely recognized as the first set of rules for recreational wargaming. While Little Wars 
                        incorporated many of the elements we today see in miniature wargaming (as - miniatures, 
                        terrain modelled to scale and measuring of distances its rules for combat outcomes were 
                        still rudimentary. Up until the 1950’s the hobby still was miniscule. In the UK, Donald 
                        Featherstone published a series of books on wargaming. In 1956 Jack Scruby of California 
                        organized the first miniature wargaming convention in America, one year after he began 
                        producing cheap miniatures intended for wargaming out of type metal. It had 14 attendants, 
                        but now the ball was rolling. Another milestone that also happened in the 50s was the 
                        first miniature wargame rule set for medieval combat by Tony Bath. This turned out to 
                        be a great inspiration to Gary Gygax Chainmail in 1971, which evolved into Dungeons & 
                        Dragons 1974. About ten years later the UK company Games Workshop published the first 
                        edition of Warhammer The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-Playing Game. In 1969 Wargames 
                        Research Group was founded and published the ruleset War Game Rules: 1000 B.C. to 
                        500 A.D. The following years rule sets generally became more and more involved and 
                        complex. In 1988 Phil Barker (one of the founders of Wargames Research Group) tried 
                        out a experimental set of rules at the Society of Ancients conference. It was a 
                        minimalistic ruleset of merely 2 pages, played on a small table only 2’x2’, with 
                        only 12 elements of 1-5 miniatures a side. The game caught on, and in 1990 De Bellis 
                        Antiquitatis was published. Keeping the philosophy of the experimental rules and adding 
                        list for armies covering 2000 years of warfare and most cultures on earth it became 
                        immensely popular. Only one year later a fantasy version was published. Hordes of the 
                        Things.

                        <h3 id="whysmall">Why is it a small game?</h3>
                        <p>Compared to many other miniature games Hordes of the Things can be considered as a 
                            very small one for several reasons:</p>
                        <h4>Low Minature Count</h4>
                        <p>Hordes of the Things is a game of battles, rather than a skirmish game, the 
                            the difference being that a skirmish game is about individual combatants 
                            whereas a battle game is about units. Unlike many battle games however you don't 
                            need an enormous amount of miniatures to play. An army typically consists of 10-14 
                            elements of troops, each element consisting of one to five miniatures mounted on 
                            a singe base.</p>
                        <h4>Space Requirement.</h4>
                        <p>Depending on the miniature scale chose the game is usually played on a battlefield 600 
                            mm by 600 mm, or 900 mm by 900 mm. A pub table is sufficient, and you might even have space
                            for your beverage of choice.</p>
                        <h4>Time Requirement</h4>
                        <p>Playing a game of Hordes of the Things rarely takes more time than an hour, including 
                            setting up everything and putting everything away.</p>
                        <h3 id="whybig">Why is it a big game?</h3>
                        <p>At the same time the game gives the feeling of large battles, sweeping movement of 
                            large bodies of troops, and a true ebb and flow of battle. Short turns make for a 
                            game where both players are involved all through it. It is quite possible to play
                            the game with more than one army a side for what can be truly epic battles.</p>
