                <h3>Hordes of the Things - the small game with the huge feeling!</h3>
                <p>What do I mean by that?</p>
                <p>The ruleset is minimal, the playing surface is small, the time requirement is around 45 
                    minutes and the model count (the number of miniatures needed to play the game) is small.</p>
                <p>At the same time the game gives the feeling of large battles, sweeping movement of large 
                    bodies of troops, and a true ebb and flow of battle.</p>
                <p>Feel welcome to look around on the site and see if you get some inspiration!</p>
